# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The video analysis results display properly shows the analysis results and generation plan. The UI design is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes. The only issue encountered was a timeout when waiting for the generation process to start, but this is expected as we're using dummy API keys. Overall, the frontend application is well-implemented and provides a good user experience."

    message: "Completed additional testing of the backend APIs after implementing a fallback cloud storage service. The file upload endpoints are now working correctly with the fallback local storage implementation. All three file upload endpoints (video, image, and audio) successfully validate file types and store the files in the appropriate local directories. The video analysis endpoint is working correctly with the litellm + Groq approach and successfully analyzes the video metadata to generate a proper analysis and plan. The video generation endpoint is working correctly and successfully starts the generation process. The background task processing is also working correctly. The entire backend workflow is now functional, with all critical issues resolved. The only expected failure is the actual video generation with RunwayML due to the dummy API key, but this is not a code issue."

    message: "MAJOR PRODUCTION UPGRADE COMPLETED: Successfully implemented Cloudflare R2 cloud storage integration to replace local storage fallback. Updated .env with actual R2 credentials provided by user. Created comprehensive cloud_storage.py module with proper R2 S3-compatible API integration, 7-day file retention, and secure file management. Fixed environment variable loading issues in server.py by restructuring cloud storage initialization. Added startup event to properly initialize cloud storage service. Successfully tested R2 connection and confirmed storage service is now using Cloudflare R2 instead of local storage. This addresses one of the major production gaps identified in logic.md. Storage service status endpoint confirms: Cloudflare R2 connected with bucket 'video-generation-storage' on account 69317cc9622018bb255db5a590d143c2."

    message: "Completed testing of the Cloudflare R2 integration. The storage service status endpoint confirms that Cloudflare R2 is properly connected with the bucket 'video-generation-storage'. All file upload endpoints (video, image, audio) are now successfully storing files in Cloudflare R2 instead of local storage. The file URLs returned by the upload endpoints are now R2 URLs starting with 'https://69317cc9622018bb255db5a590d143c2.r2.cloudflarestorage.com' as expected. The project details endpoint confirms that the R2 URLs are properly stored in the database. Had to fix one issue with the R2 integration: the 'x-amz-tagging' header is not supported by Cloudflare R2, so we removed it and added the retention information to the metadata instead. After this fix, the R2 integration is working perfectly. This completes the production upgrade to use cloud storage instead of local storage."

    message: "Completed testing of the MongoDB to PostgreSQL migration. The database status endpoint confirms that the PostgreSQL database is properly connected. However, there are issues with the MongoDB compatibility layer in database.py. The main issue is that the MongoDB compatibility layer is not properly handling async operations with PostgreSQL. When trying to create a project, we get the error 'TypeError: object NoneType can't be used in 'await' expression'. This suggests that the insert_one method in the MongoCollection class is not returning an awaitable object, but the code in server.py is trying to await it. Additionally, there's a foreign key constraint in the PostgreSQL schema requiring that the user_id in the video_projects table must exist in the users table, but our test is trying to create a project with a user ID that doesn't exist in the users table. These issues need to be fixed for the PostgreSQL migration to work properly."
